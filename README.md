# lcls_cu_injector_tuning


Working repo for the LCLS Cu line injector tuning

Simple surrogate model with examples for i/o and bayesian optimization (using https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization):

* **Basic examples of both io and a simple BO run:** https://github.com/slaclab/lcls_cu_injector_tuning/blob/main/models/simple_models/injector_simple_io.ipynb 

* **More involved comparison with measured data and scanning through surrogate model inputs and verifying BO:** https://github.com/slaclab/lcls_cu_injector_tuning/blob/main/models/simple_models/LCLS_Cu_Inj_scalar_beam_size_emit_OTR2_EASY.ipynb
